## Projects

###### The Button
- Small horror game where your goal was to avoid alarms and reach the terminal. Game's basically finished, but doesn't deserve any notice.

######  Project NIT
- This was a solo passion project where I created the arts, animations, map design, story, and code. Project NIT is a 3D-collectathon platformer where you play as a character traversing through time collecting pieces of energetic bricks. More information would be on the Trello dashboard, which is also in my Discord. The game is currently on-hold.

######  Discord Bot
- I got bored one day, decided it was best to create a simple Discord bot. Currecntly inactive. It's commands were 100% all dad jokes, so there's no reason for me to keep it alive.

######  Meat's Motel - Website
- This was an introduction to HTML coding. Planning to use this website or other sorts, as in displaying my artwork and developments. Currently hosting on https://www.meatsmotel.com/

######  Project Awry
- My current project for the time. Virtual reality stuff, more information later. Literally nothing was developed as I'm currently stressed on studies. Sorry.

Currently, my projects are availible to view on my community Discord.
Note, those projects are either in Hiatus or Canceled due to studies. Sob.
