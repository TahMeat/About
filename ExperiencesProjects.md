## Projects
This list does not have ALL of my projects.

###### Ahoy
- Current free-time project relating to music theory. Music is very cool. Think of it as an interactive turn-based RPG, set in an environment of islands you can sail to.

######  Project NIT
- This was a solo passion project where I created the arts, animations, map design, story, and code. Project NIT is a 3D-collectathon platformer where you play as a character traversing through time collecting pieces of energetic bricks. More information would be on the Trello dashboard, which is also in my Discord. The game is abandonware.

######  Meat's Motel - Website
- This was an introduction to HTML coding. Planning to use this website or another sort, to display my artwork and developments. Currently hosting on https://www.meatsmotel.com/

###### The Button
- Small horror game where your goal was to avoid alarms and reach the terminal. The game's finished but doesn't deserve any notice.

######  Project Awry
- Virtual reality stuff, very early stage. Not worth talking about.

######  Discord Bot
- I got bored one day and decided it was best to create a simple Discord bot. Currently inactive. Its commands were 100% all dad jokes, so there's no reason for me to keep it alive.


Currently, my projects are available to view on my community Discord.
Note, that those projects are either on Hiatus or canceled. Sob.
