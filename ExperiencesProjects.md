## Projects

######  Meat's Motel - Website
- This was an introduction to HTML coding and design. Multiple pages, which should include an "About" section to clearly display any projects I've worked on. Some pages are inside-jokes within my community and serves as a way to embed things into social media. Currently hosting on https://www.meatsmotel.com/

######  Project NIT
- This was a solo passion project where I created the arts, animations, map design, story, and code. Project NIT is a 3D-collectathon platformer where you play as a character traversing through time collecting pieces of energetic bricks. More information would be on the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/NHEtUb2P/noob-in-time) dashboard, which is also in my Discord. The game is forever on-hold.

###### The Button
- Small horror game where your goal was to avoid alarms and reach the terminal. Game's basically finished, but doesn't deserve any notice.

######  Discord Bot
- I got bored one day, decided it was best to create a simple Discord bot. Currecntly inactive. It's commands were 100% all dad jokes, so there's no reason for me to keep it alive. All for jokes, haha.

######  Project Awry
- My current project for the time. Virtual reality stuff, more information on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/V6xknIOE/awry-vr). Nothing major was developed as I'm currently on studies. Sorry. I do this for fun. :)

Currently, my projects are availible to view on my community Discord.
